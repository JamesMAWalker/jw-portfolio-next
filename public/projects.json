First, the website was an older WordPress site whose design was dated and unappealing, as well as quite slow, due to a lack of maintenance. The second was the increasing reliance on third party delivery services for both delivery as well as visibility.",
        "The first issue was mostly a matter of modernizing the design of the site. The client wanted something clean that put the mission and the food first, but that would also communicate their modern practices. My approach was to keep the design stark and simple, and to use some more modern animation and interaction to emphasize the contemporary feel they were after."

Second, the menu itself eschews the typical screenshot or PDF of an existing menu - instead it’s the most interactive aspect of the application.",

Once an item is selected, the current order also becomes easily accessible from anywhere on the page. This allows quick and intuitive editing, and a frictionless experience that nets more conversions into actual orders."

        "The first element of this to tackle was the ease of use. The very accessible and intuitive menu design was step one of this process, but the other half comes when we consider the actual ordering process. Handling payments, validating addresses, offering shipping and order tracking information - these are all elements offered by the third-party delivery services we’re trying to supersede. ",
        "To this end I employed the use of another third-party service. However, this third party simply provides an API whose code can be used to manage all the stated concerns, and at a fraction of the extended cost incurred by their current delivery system."
